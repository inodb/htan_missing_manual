# Submitting Publications

To facilitate data sharing and adherence to FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles, the HTAN portal provides links to specimen files used in publications. Currently, the HTAN Data Coordinating Center (DCC) faciliates this linking once provided the appropriate information by HTAN Centers.  To submit publication information, HTAN Center's should contact Alex Lash at alexl@ds.dfci.harvard.edu. 

!!! *In order to support data sharing and public data access, publications should either:*
* *use HTAN identifiers; or* 
* *provide a lookup table in the publication to map publication identifiers to HTAN identifiers.*
