# Data Release

HTAN releases data at regular intervals.  HTAN Centers are notified of the data submission deadline for an upcoming data release.  After that deadline, the data release itself involves a number of data processing and verification steps.  Please see [HTAN Data Release Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15xvIbfyQmgbMD_uB2e0SwPFw67_AePB5YspF4dsilCA/edit#heading=h.tddsmkcn4p1p) for more information regarding the data release process.
