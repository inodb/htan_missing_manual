# NCI's Cancer Data Service

**NOTE**: dbGaP approval for HTAN study [phs002371](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002371.v3.p1) is required in order to access HTAN lower-level genomics data, such as RNAseq FASTQ and BAM files.

The [CDS Portal](https://dataservice.datacommons.cancer.gov/), within NCI's Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), provides an interface to filter and select data from a variety of NCI programs, including controlled-access, primary sequence data from the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN). 

In order to access these HTAN data within the [CDS Portal](https://dataservice.datacommons.cancer.gov/), navigate to the portal in a web browser and click on the **Explore CDS Data** button on the landing page.
