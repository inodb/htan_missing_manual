# NCI's Cancer Data Service

The [CDS Portal](https://dataservice.datacommons.cancer.gov/), within NCI's Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), provides access to both open and controlled access data. 

CDS currently hosts a variety of data types from NCI projects, including those from the [Human Tumor Atlas Network](https://dataservice.datacommons.cancer.gov/#/study/phs002371). 

dbGaP approval for HTAN study [phs002371](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002371.v3.p1) is required in order to access HTAN lower-level genomics data, such as RNAseq FASTQ and BAM files.
