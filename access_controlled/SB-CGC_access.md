# SB-CGC Cancer Data Service (CDS) Explorer

**NOTE**: dbGaP approval for HTAN study [phs002371](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002371.v3.p1) is required in order to access HTAN lower-level genomics data, such as RNAseq FASTQ and BAM files.

Once your dbGaP application has been approved, you can access HTAN data via the **Cancer Data Service browser** within the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud. To do so, head to [Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud](https://www.cancergenomicscloud.org/), and log in with your ERA Commons credentials.

Once logged in, navigate to the top navigation bar, and select **Data > Cancer Data Service Explorer**.
