# Data Standard Levels

The HTAN data model divides assay data into levels. Each assay type has levels progressing from raw data to more processed data.  This is illustrated in the following figure for sequencing data.  Please see each assay's page within [Data Standards](https://humantumoratlas.org/standards) for more information.

Clinical data is organized into tiers.  These tiers are described more on the [Clinical Data Page](https://humantumoratlas.org/standard/clinical). 

The [Data Standards](https://humantumoratlas.org/standards) provides up-to-date details regarding the HTAN Data Model. For additional notes regarding how to submit data for each data type, please see the [Specific Assay/Data Element Details](../data_submission/specific_details.md) page of this manual.
