# Data Standards

This page is a place holder for a data standards page/set of data standards pages similar to [MC2 Center Data Model](https://mc2-center.github.io/data-models/).  The HTAN version of the MC2 tables will include additional columns such as "required_if_component" and "required_if_value".  Until the new pages are constructed, please see the information on the [Data Standards](https://humantumoratlas.org/standards) page of the HTAN Data Portal.

!!! Note
Once these pages are added, the [Data Standards](https://humantumoratlas.org/standards) page will be removed from the data portal.  All links to "Data Standards" throughout this manual will need to be updated.
