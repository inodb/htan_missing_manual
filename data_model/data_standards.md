# Data Standards

This page is a place holder for a data standards page/set of data standards pages similar to [MC2 Center Data Model](https://mc2-center.github.io/data-models/).  The HTAN version of the MC2 tables will include additional columns such as "required_if_component" and "required_if_value".  See [data-models issue#354](https://github.com/ncihtan/data-models/issues/354) for more information. 

!!! Note
Once these pages are added, the [Data Standards](https://humantumoratlas.org/standards) page will be removed from the data portal.  All links to "Data Standards" throughout this manual will need to be updated.
