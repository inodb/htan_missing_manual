# Spatial Transcriptomics

The HTAN data model for spatial transcriptomics data is based upon both imaging and single cell sequencing data models. These form a collection of metadata fields where transcriptomic levels (or gene or protein level measures) can be mapped to locations on a tissue slide, and were developed in consultation with the data generating centers who are both experts in imaging metadata (e.g. DICOM and OME) and multiple large-scale atlas projects.

The HTAN data model currently supports 10X Visium data, but additional platforms will be added in the near future including Nanostring GeoMX and Pick-Seq.

Spatial transcriptomic sequencing datasets are typically comprised of RNA-sequencing data at varying levels, coupled with imaging data and an auxiliary set of files used in or generated by processing workflows for spatial transcriptomics:

| Level | Description                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Spatial Transcriptomics RNA-seq Level 1 | Files contain raw RNA-seq data associated with spot/slide data.                                                                |
| Spatial Transcriptomics RNA-seq Level 2 | Alignment workflows downstream of Spatial Transcriptomics RNA-seq Level 1.                                                     |
| Spatial Transcriptomics RNA-seq Level 3 | Processed data files based on Spatial Transcriptomics RNA-seq Level 2 and Spatial Transcriptomics Auxiliary files.             |
| Spatial Transcriptomics RNA-seq Level 4 | Processed data files based on Spatial Transcriptomics RNA-seq Level 3.                                                         |
| Spatial Transcriptomics Auxiliary Files | Auxiliary data associated with spot/slide analysis (aligned Images, quality control files, etc) from Spatial Transcriptomics.  |
| Imaging Level 2 | Imaging data compiled into a single file format, preferably a tiled and pyramidal OME-TIFF. |
