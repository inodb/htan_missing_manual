# Submitting Publications

Publications are submitted to HTAN via the publications metadata template on Synapse Data Curator App ([DCA](https://dca.app.sagebionetworks.org/)).  To access the DCA, you must be a Synapse [certified user](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Synapse-User-Account-Types.2007072795.html).   

The metadata template will facilitate linking a HTAN publication to the specimen and assay files used in the publication.  

!!! *In order to support data sharing and public data access, publications should either use HTAN identifiers or provide a lookup table to map publication identifiers to HTAN identifiers.*
