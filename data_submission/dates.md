# What is the index date?

HTAN cannot accept dates because they are considered Protect Health Information (PHI). In order to obfuscate dates, they should be converted
to days from an index date.  In this case, the index date is the participant's date of birth.  For example, a participant's therapy start date 
would be recorded as 365 days if the therapy took place 365 days after a participant's date of birth.
