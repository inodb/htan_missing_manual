# Accessing Images via SB-CGC Cancer Data Service (CDS)

HTAN Imaging Level 2 data is now available through the [NCI Cancer Data Service (CDS)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/cancer-data-service).

Data access via Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (SB-CGC) requires a CGC account [[register here](https://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/sign-up-for-the-cgc)]. For further information on using SB-CGC resources including programmatic access options, you can explore their [online documentation](https://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs).
