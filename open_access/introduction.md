# Open Access Data

:exclamation: might be best to break this into with each data release... data in HTAN portal, sb-cgc, bigquery...others are subset if data?


Open access HTAN data is available via the following services and tools:

[!ref target="blank" text="HTAN Data Portal"](https://data.humantumoratlas.org/explore)

[!ref target="blank" text="Synapse?"](https://synapse.org)  :exclamation: data portal has "Synapse" as data access -- where is the data for public users of synapse?

[!ref target="blank" text="CellxGene"](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/)

[!ref target="blank" text="The NCI Image Data Commons (IDC)"](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/)

[!ref target="blank" text="Seven Bridges-Cancer Genomic Cloud (SB-CGC)"](https://cgc-accounts.sbgenomics.com/)

[!ref target="blank" text="Google BigQuery"](https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/)

[!ref target="blank" text="cBioPortal"](https://www.cbioportal.org/)

The HTAN Data Portal provides an overview of all released data.  The Portal also provides links to: 
- CellxGene for visualization of single cell RNA-sequencing data
- Minerva rendered images and stories.
- Google BigQuery tables. 
- cBioPortal 

Open Access Images can be accessed and downloaded from SB-CGC as well as the IDC.

Google BigQuery Access provides direct access to a subset of assay data (mainly level 4 files) on a cloud platform.  The Google BigQuery tables provide an easy way to build cohorts using specific data fields.  HTAN also provides sample code for working with the data in Google BigQuery.
