Open access HTAN data is available via the following services and tools:

[!ref target="blank" text="HTAN Data Portal"](https://data.humantumoratlas.org/explore)

[!ref target="blank" text="Synapse?"](https://synapse.org)  :exclamation: data portal has "Synapse" as data access -- where is the data for public users of synapse?

[!ref target="blank" text="CellxGene"](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/)

[!ref target="blank" text="The NCI Image Data Commons (IDC)"](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/)

[!ref target="blank" text="Seven Bridges-Cancer Genomic Cloud (SB-CGC)"](https://cgc-accounts.sbgenomics.com/)

[!ref target="blank" text="Google BigQuery"](https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/)

[!ref target="blank" text="cBioPortal"](https://www.cbioportal.org/)

The HTAN Data Portal provides an overview of all publicly released data and links to: 
- CellxGene for visualization of single cell RNA-sequencing data
- Minerva rendered images and stories.
- Google BigQuery tables. 
- cBioPortal 

Open Access Images can be accessed and downloaded from SB-CGC as well as the IDC.

Google BigQuery Access provides direct access to a subset of assay data (mainly level 4 files) on a cloud platform.  The Google BigQuery tables provide an easy way to build cohorts using specific data fields.  HTAN also provides sample code for working with the data in Google BigQuery.

!!! For more detailed information about the HTAN Portal, CellxGene, Visualizing Images, Accessing Images via SB-CGC and/or Using Google BigQuery, please see the next sections of this manual.
