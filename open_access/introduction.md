# Open Access Data

Open access HTAN data is available via the following services and tools:

-  The [HTAN Data Portal](https://data.humantumoratlas.org/explore)
-  [Synapse](synapse.org)  :exclamation: data portal has "Synapse" as data access -- where is the data for public users of synapse?
-  [CellxGene](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/)
-  The NCI Image Data Commons [(IDC)](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/)
-  Seven Bridges-Cancer Genomic Cloud [(SB-CGC)](https://cgc-accounts.sbgenomics.com/)
-  Google BigQuery via the Institute for Systems Biology Cancer Gateway in the Cloud [(ISB-CGC)](https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/)
-  [cBioPortal](https://www.cbioportal.org/)

The HTAN Data Portal provides an overview of all publicly released data and links to: 
- CellxGene for visualization of single cell RNA-sequencing data
- Minerva rendered images and stories.
- Google BigQuery tables. 
- cBioPortal 

Open Access Images can be downloaded from SB-CGC.

Google BigQuery Access provides direct access to a subset of assay data (mainly level 4 files) on a cloud platform.  The Google BigQuery tables provide an easy way to build cohorts using spcific data fields.
