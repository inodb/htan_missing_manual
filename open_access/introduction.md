# Open Access Data

Open access HTAN data is available via:

-   The HTAN Data Portal
-   NCI Image Data Commons (IDC)   :exclamation: change this to CDC?
-   Google BigQuery
:exclamation: add CellxGene?

!!! Would add a brief overview of when to go where.  eg. access x in Data Portal....if you want to XXX go to CellxGene....if you want to XXX go to BigQuery...etc 
!!!
